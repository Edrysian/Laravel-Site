# My Notes

I will include any notes I have in this file.

I made a mistake in trying to follow a different guide online. I have managed to revert the main branch back to it's state before following the guide, while keeping all of the changes that were made on 2 seperate branches called `adding-Pages` and `noFollowDocs`.

These are two branches that I will return to eventually, as I plan on following the Laravel documentation specifically from now on. Right now the branches have errors which stop the site from running and every time I fix an error another pops up. So, I have reverted to sticking with the Laravel documentation as I should have done in the first place.
